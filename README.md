Project on Web store Management-

Overview of the Project-
        My project consists of a main page as an introduction about me .It is containing a button ‘Enter Project’ through which we can enter the project. Then the next page of mine contains four buttons that are ‘Brands’, ’Purchase Details’ ,’Deals’ ,’Contact us’ and an image .
        
1. By clicking on ‘Brands’ Button we move to another window in which we can see various brands available in the store and its images. There we can select any brands available to see its models available in the store by clicking on the ‘Models’ Button. 

           After when we select the ‘Models’   we move to another window where we can see the various ‘Models’ available in the store related to that particular brand we selected .In that page we can see the specifications of the various models by clicking on the ‘Specifications’ Button .After seeing the specifications we can move to the purchase option or go back to the previous window.               
           When we click on the ‘purchase’ button we move to another window where we have to fill the details about us and then click on buy and proceed for the transaction or the mode of payment. 
           
         Then in another window we will select the mode of transaction and confirm. After the confirmation you purchase is successful and your laptop is booked. We can   go  back  to  the  previous  windows  to  select  another brands or another models.
